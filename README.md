This repository contains my custom solutions📝 to problems from the Algoexpert course. Algoexpert is an online platform that offers a curated collection of coding interview questions and provides in-depth video explanations and solutions.

Most solutions here have been verified on Leetcode🚀 or similar platforms to ensure correctness✅ of logic. Initially, I didn't set out for the repository to be this exhaustive,
hence most of my earlier work still resides in main.py. However, as the project grew, I began to keep each subsequent solution in its own file. 

I use Pycharm for all things Python, and simply cannot imagine a life without Jetbrains IDEs at my disposal. Debugging is now an essential tool🛠️ in my arsenal. 
It has proven to be a lifesaver🛟 on several occasions and saved me countless hours of unproductive work.

I struggled a lot in the early days, taking hours🕒 at times to come up with answers to even the most simple problems. 

I had resolved to never look at the official solution beforehand as I wanted to attempt every problem without any preconceived notion of what the perfect answer should look like. 
After all, that's the way it is in the real world🌎. I wanted to arrive at the solution organically🌱, and observe patterns I could potentially exploit. 

I would stay up all night🌃 at times, iterating over my answers until my code submission achieved the desired time complexity⏰. 
Even when it did satisfy the time requirements, I would try to further simplify the logic - strip it down to the barebones🦴, without any fluff.
That's how I ensure I remember🧠 this stuff in the long run. Every now and then, I casually go through this code and try to recall the ideas I learnt while sipping a nice cup of coffee☕. 

I failed several times. I had to take a quick peek🫣 at the final code quite a few times for inspiration. But only a glance.
With practice, and a keen desire to gain mastery of the exquisite art of programming, I improved🎯. It didn't happen overnight, but I never gave up. 

I present to you over a month of dedicated efforts💡 neatly encapsulated in this repository. Solving these challenges helped me grow as a programmer, 
gain a deeper intuition about coding and gave me an opportunity to experiment with ideas & concepts I had always known but never got around to trying without a fear of failure😱. 

Some of the solutions I am most proud of are [Boggle Board](boggle_board.py), [Waterfall Streams](waterfall_streams.py) and [Spiral Traverse](spiral_traverse.py) to name a few.

Feel free to explore the solutions and learn from them. You may find different approaches to solving the same problem, optimized algorithms, or new problem-solving techniques.
